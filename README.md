# IIT Madras Mobility Application

## Project Overview

The IITM-Mobile Smartphone Application is a innovative solution designed to collect travel demand and trip patterns data within the IIT Madras campus, addressing critical challenges of mobility, sustainability, and campus safety.

## Motivation

The project aims to tackle several key challenges:
- Increasing vehicular traffic on campus
- Traffic congestion
- Air and noise pollution
- Limited parking spaces
- Wildlife protection and reducing animal-vehicle collisions

### Campus Context
- Campus Population: Approximately 9,800 people
- Campus Area: 617 acres
- Biodiversity:
  - Wildlife: Blackbuck, chital, bonnet macaque, and various smaller life forms
  - Flora: 300 species of trees and plants
  - Fauna: 100 species of birds (resident and migratory)

## Objectives

- Develop a smartphone application for accurate trip data collection
- Create a sustainable mobility solution
- Reduce private motorized trips by at least 70%
- Provide a mobility service with less than 10 minutes' notice
- Ensure minimal walking distance (within 3 minutes)

## Key Features

### Smartphone App Functionality

1. **User Privacy**
   - No continuous tracking
   - Data recorded only at predefined "virtual monuments"

2. **Virtual Monuments**
   - Geofenced areas with unique GPS coordinates
   - Reduced data collection errors
   - Enhanced user privacy

3. **User Registration**
   - Secure registration process
   - Optional phone number registration

4. **Data Logging**
   - Monument ID tracking
   - Date and time of entry/exit
   - Near real-time data transmission

5. **Additional Features**
